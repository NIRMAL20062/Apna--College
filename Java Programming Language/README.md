# **🔥 DSA with Java: My Blood, Sweat, and Infinite StackOverflow Tabs**  

**Welcome to my chaotic journey of learning Data Structures & Algorithms in Java!**  
*Spoiler: It’s 10% genius, 90% "Why is my linked list circular now?"*  

---

## **📜 The Saga of My Suffering (a.k.a Progress)**  

### **Phase 1: Java Basics – "Hello World" to "Hello… why is this NullPointerException?"**  
✔️ **Variables**: `int pain = 100;`  
✔️ **Loops**: `while(alive) { coffee++; }`  
✔️ **OOP**: Wrote a `Person` class. Still figuring out how to `extends` my patience.  
✔️ **Collections**: `ArrayList`? More like `ArrayLust`—I love it until it throws `ConcurrentModificationException`.  

### **Phase 2: Data Structures – "I Thought Arrays Were Hard… Then Came Trees"**  
✔️ **Arrays**: Easy. Until I tried rotating one.  
✔️ **Linked Lists**: Spent 3 hours debugging. Realized I was pointing to `null` like my future.  
✔️ **Stacks & Queues**: Finally understood them… after drawing 47 diagrams on a napkin.  
🔲 **Trees**: Currently stuck. My binary tree is more like a binary *trap*.  
🔲 **Graphs**: Heard DFS stands for *"Damn, Forgot Syntax"*.  

### **Phase 3: Algorithms – "From Bubble Sort to Existential Crisis"**  
✔️ **Big-O**: Realized O(n²) is just my life’s time complexity.  
✔️ **Sorting**: Merge Sort? More like *"Merge Sorrow"*.  
✔️ **Searching**: Binary search works great… unless the array isn’t sorted (oops).  
🔲 **DP**: Dynamic Programming. More like *"Dramatic Panicking"*.

## **💻 How to Run My (Probably Buggy) Code**  
1. Clone this repo (if you dare):  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/dsa-pain-java.git
   ```  
2. Compile & run:  
   ```bash
   javac WhyIsThisNotWorking.java
   java WhyIsThisNotWorking
   ```  
   *(Output: `Exception in thread "main" java.lang.StackOverflowError`)*

## **📚 Resources That (Sort Of) Helped**  
- **Books**:  
  - *"Java: The Complete Reference"* (Complete? Lies.)  
  - *"Cracking the Coding Interview"* (More like *"Cracking My Sanity"*).  
- **Websites**:  
  - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) – Where I go to feel stupid.  
  - [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) – The holy grail of copy-pasting.  
- **Youtube**:  
  - *"How to invert a binary tree in 5 mins"* (Took me 5 hours).  

---

## **💡 Key Takeaways (So Far)**  
✅ **Recursion**: It’s magic… until it’s a `StackOverflowError`.  
✅ **Debugging**: 80% crying, 20% adding `System.out.println()`.  
✅ **Big-O Notation**: O(1) = God-tier. O(n!) = "I should quit coding."

## **🚨 Disclaimer**  
⚠️ **This repo may contain:**  
- Code that compiles but shouldn’t.  
- Solutions that work… *sometimes*.  
- Comments like `// TODO: Fix this (lol)`

## **🙏 Final Plea**  
If you find this repo:  
- **Star it** (so I feel validated).  
- **Open an issue** (if you spot a bug… or a cry for help).  
- **Send coffee** (I’m running on fumes).
