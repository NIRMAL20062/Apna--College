// r Constructors are special methods used to initialize objects.
// b Constructors are called when an object is created.
// g Constructors have the same name as the class and do not have a return type.
// y Constructors can be overloaded, meaning you can have multiple constructors with different parameters.
// v Constructors can be used to set initial values for object fields.  
// i Constructors can also be used to perform any setup or initialization tasks required for the object.
// o     Constructors can be used to enforce certain conditions when creating an object, such as ensuring that a balance is positive.   
//m  Constructors can be used to create immutable objects by not providing setters for the fields.


/* 
// r ðŸ§© Key Features of Constructors:
Feature	Description
Name	Must have the same name as the class
No Return Type	Doesnâ€™t have a return type â€” not even void
Auto-called	Automatically called when you create an object with new
Can Be Overloaded	You can create multiple constructors with different parameter lists
