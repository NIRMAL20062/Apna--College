// p Shallow copy creates a new reference to the same object, while deep copy creates a new object with its own copy of the data.
// p In Java, shallow copy can be created by simply assigning one object to another.
// p Deep copy can be achieved by creating a new object and copying the values of the original object's fields.
// p In the example, modifying the original object after creating a shallow copy affects the shallow copy, but not the deep copy.
// p This demonstrates the difference between shallow and deep copy in Java.
// p Shallow copy is faster and uses less memory, but deep copy is safer when dealing with mutable objects.
